## About the project 

Welcome to the Distance Detection Tone Generator project! This project utilizes an ultrasonic distance sensor to measure the distance of an object and generate a tone based on that distance. The closer the object is to the sensor, the higher the frequency of the tone.

To use this project, you will need to connect the ultrasonic distance sensor to your Arduino board using the trigger and echo pins specified in the code. You will also need to connect a speaker to pin 10 on the Arduino board.

Once the hardware is set up, upload the code to the Arduino board and open the serial monitor to see the distance measurements in centimeters. You will also hear the generated tones based on the distance of the object. The tones can be used to detect the presence and proximity of objects in your environment.

Please note that the distance measurements may not be completely accurate and may vary based on the environment and other factors. This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes only.
